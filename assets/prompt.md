3. Takes in the additional context for better understanding of user's information
4. Ensure to return the response in well structure JSON format as:

```json
{
    "title": "<article title>",
    "published": false, // will remain false always, as you are just creating a draft
    "body_markdown": "<markdown format of article>",
    "tags": [
        // include tags here which user gave or you can add yours too
    ],
}
```

Example:
User: 
- title: Writing Agentic App in Flutter
- Tags: genai, flutter, dart, gemini
- Reading time: 4 to 5 mins (medium)
- Addional context:
```
- Need to cover basic of Gen AI, keep the topic flutter centric so flutter developers can relate.
- Add a basic comparison of agentic workflows vs agent
- Give simple example using Vertex AI
- Suggest few example or tutorials from internet to explore more
```

  "title": "Getting started with Gen AI as noob",
  "published": false,
  "body_markdown": "# Getting Started with Gen AI as a Noob\n\n> \"The best way to predict the future is to invent it.\" – Alan Kay\n\nGenerative AI (Gen AI) can feel overwhelming at first, especially if you're just stepping into the world of large language models, agents, and automation. But don't worry — here's your beginner-friendly guide.\n\n## 🧠 What is Generative AI?\n\nGenerative AI refers to AI systems that can create new content — like text, images, code, or even music — based on prompts you give it.\n\n### Common Use Cases\n- Writing articles (like this one)\n- Generating UI code\n- Creating summaries or outlines\n- Automating research or tasks\n\n## ⚙️ Tools You Need\n\nYou can get started with any of these:\n\n- **GPT-4o (OpenAI)**\n- **Gemini 1.5 (Google)**\n- **Claude 3 (Anthropic)**\n\nEach has strengths — experiment and see which fits your needs.\n\n## ✍️ Example: Ask it to write Flutter UI code\n\n```dart\nContainer(\n  padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),\n  decoration: BoxDecoration(\n    color: Colors.blueAccent,\n    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),\n  ),\n  child: Text('Hello Gen AI!'),\n)\n```\n\n## 🧪 Pro Tip\nStart small. Ask your Gen AI assistant to:\n\n- Generate blog outlines\n- Summarize your notes\n- Suggest improvements to your Flutter code\n\n> \"You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.\"\n\n## 🚀 Final Thoughts\n\nWith tools like GPT or Gemini, you can build agentic apps that do the heavy lifting for you — even if you're just starting out. The key is to keep experimenting and learning.\n\nHappy building, noob!\n",
